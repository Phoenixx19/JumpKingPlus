*An enhanced version of Jump King.* :sparkles:

JumpKingPlus is an **enhancement** for Jump King with plentiful of small tweaks to make your hard climb to the babe even better! JumpKingPlus fully **supports** the community around the game <!--  more --> and has taken notes on the features/tweaks the game was missing and implemented it (such as a quick restart system, disabling the NPC speeches for full focus on those hard jumps and so on!).
