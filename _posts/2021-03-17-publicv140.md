## Changelog

Public release update.
Download available [**here**](https://github.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/releases/tag/v1.4.0). <!-- more -->

## Please consider reading this if you are making a map!
With the update v1.4.0, an error will occur once opened a game with an older map.
To fix that, install the new [**earthquake_settings.xml**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/master/docs/workshop/files/earthquake_settings.xml) file and place it inside `mods/gui`. The *"Sample custom level"* in the workshop page has been updated already.

### Features added:
Mods:
- Added 16 gradients of a wind block.
- Added 16 gradients of left one-way wind block. (thanks to Abaddon!)
- Added 16 gradients of right one-way wind block. (thanks to Abaddon!)

>Check out more about it in the [**documentation**](https://phoenixx19.github.io/JumpKingPlus/workshop/documentation/#hitbox-file).

Tweaks:
- Added the __Detailed Ending__ that displays if the player has won with:
  - Giant Boots
  - Snake Ring
  - Both
  - None of the above 

>The Detailed Ending is still a bit unstable / not working.
