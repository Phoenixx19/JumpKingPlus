## Changelog

Public release update.
Download available [**here**](https://github.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/releases/tag/v1.3.0). <!-- more -->

### Features added:
Mods:
- Added a build mode to help level creators and editors. The Build Helper prints out on the right corner of your Jump King session:
    - Current name location
    - Current screen number
    - X axis on the current screen
    - Y axis on the current screen
    - Boolean value that tells the player if they are standing on an ice, sand, snow or solid block or if they have triggered the knocked value.

Tweaks:
- The Build Helper for obvious reasons works only for custom maps; why would you need that on a vanilla map!?
- The new build mode can be set inside the `JumpKing.exe.config` file (by putting the value to "True").
- By default, the build mode enables the `Load and save position` tool.

Fixes:
- The cheats menu in-game will show only when cheats are on, custom maps will no longer trigger them.
- Fixed a problem where World Items were not possible to remove using the `/mods/props/worlditems/worlditems.xml` file.

Installer fixes:

*"I'm slowly trying to improve the current Wix# installer but that thing sucks."* ~Phoenixx19

- Implemented functions that prints out the error, if the installer fails.
